# 29-card-game-
a single player card game in c#.   


Description
This is one of a group of South Asian trick-taking games in which the Jack and the Nine are the highest cards in every suit. It is almost certain that they are descended from the European family of Jass games, which originated in the Netherlands. Probably they were brought to the Indian subcontinent by Dutch traders.
The descriptions of this game I have seen disagree with each other in many details.
The total card points in hand are 28.
So, why it is called 29??
 In some versions of the game, the last trick is worth an extra card point, for a total of 29: this total explains the name of the game.
 Most players nowadays do not count the point for the last trick, but the name of the game is still 29, even when playing this version with only 28 points.
This game is having total of 28 points. No extra point for last trick.

Please see 'Help' to know the rules and ways to play this game.
